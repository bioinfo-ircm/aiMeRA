Description: The aiMeRA package provides tools to infer connectivity among a the entities composing a biological system. The inference is obtained by applying Modular Response Analysis (MRA) principles (Kholodenko, PNAS, 2002). Inference of the effect of combined perturbations based on an MRA model is also available.
